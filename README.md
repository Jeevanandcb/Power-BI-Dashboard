# HR Analytics Power-BI-Dashboard


This project is an analysis of employee attrition in a fictional company using Power BI. The goal of the project is to identify the factors that contribute to employee turnover and to provide insights that can help the company retain its employees.

The project contains several visualizations that provide an overview of the company's employee data, including a breakdown of employees by department, gender, age, and education level. There are also visualizations that show the company's attrition rate over time and the reasons why employees are leaving the company.

The data used in this project is a sample dataset that simulates employee data from a real company. The data includes information on employee demographics, job roles, performance, and attrition.

To run the project, you will need to have Power BI Desktop installed on your computer. Once you have downloaded the project files from GitHub, you can open the project in Power BI Desktop and begin exploring the data.

This project is intended for anyone who is interested in HR analytics or wants to learn how to use Power BI for data analysis. It provides a good starting point for exploring employee attrition data and identifying trends that can help improve employee retention.

Please feel free to use this project as a reference for your own analysis or to contribute to the project by adding your own insights and visualizations.
